                    <ul>
                        <li>Fuel cells use the chemical energy of hydrogen or other fuels to efficiently produce clean electricity.

                            If theyâ€™re utilizing hydrogen, their only outputs will be electricity, water, and heat.
                            
                           <br> Fuel cells have a myriad of potential applications; they can use a wide range of fuels and feedstocks and can provide power for systems as large as a utility power station and as small as a laptop computer.
                            
                            <br>Fuel cells can be used in a wide range of applications, providing power for applications across multiple sectors, including transportation, industrial/commercial/residential buildings, and long-term energy storage for the grid in reversible systems.

                    <h5>Benefits</h5><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fuel cells have several benefits over conventional combustion-based technologies currently used in many power plants and vehicles. Fuel cells can operate at higher efficiencies than combustion engines and can convert the chemical energy in the fuel directly to electrical energy with efficiencies capable of exceeding 60%. Fuel cells have lower or zero emissions compared to combustion engines. Hydrogen fuel cells emit only water, addressing critical climate challenges as there are no carbon dioxide emissions. There also are no air pollutants that create smog and cause health problems at the point of operation. Fuel cells are quiet during operation as they have few moving parts.
