                    <ul>
                        <li>Solar energy is energy that comes from sunlight. 
                        Photovoltaic panels or mirrors are used to concentrate 
                        solar radiation, which is the light energy emitted by the sun. 
                        This energy is used to generate electricity, and can also 
                        be used for longer term energy storage by being stored 
                        in batteries or in thermal storage.

                    <h5>Benefits</h5><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Due to the fact that the amount of sunlight that strikes 
                            the Earth in an hour and a half is enough to handle the 
                            entire world’s energy consumption for a full year, the 
                            use of solar technologies to capture sunlight for energy 
                            is very prevalent as it is an opportunity to use this energy 
                            and direct it towards humans’ energy needs. <br>
                        One benefit is cost savings. For residential solar electricity 
                        systems, there are often lower monthly utility bills compared 
                        with traditional electricity systems.
                        <br>Another benefit is the adaptability. Most states have 
                        good-to-excellent solar resources, with areas with low solar 
                        resources have similar levels to that of countries with highly 
                        developed solar photovoltaics such as Germany. <br>Furthermore, 
                        the amount of solar energy needed is relatively low, as just one 
                        hour of noontime summer sun is equal to the annual US electricity 
                        demand.<br>
                        Another benefit is the environmental benefits. Every kilowatt-hour 
                        (kWh) of solar energy that is generated reduces greenhouse gas 
                        emissions like CO2, in addition to other dangerous pollutants 
                        such as sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. 
                        Not only that, but solar energy also reduces water consumption.

                    <h5>Limitations</h5><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Locations with lower sunlight levels may have more difficulty with implementing fully solar generated energy systems. 
                            Some major limitations of solar energy are first of all, the availability and amount of sunlight that arrives at the earth's surface varies depending on time of day, location, season of the year, and weather conditions.
                            <br>The second limitation is the amount of sunlight reaching a square foot of the earth's surface is relatively small, so a large surface area is necessary to absorb or collect enough energy to be useful. There can also be environmental impacts when constructing utility-scale solar energy facilities.                            Many factors can also limit the efficiency of solar cells’ ability to generate energy.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Solar energy uses photovoltaic cells, 
                            also called solar cells, to generate 
                            energy. When light shines on the cell, 
                            the light may reflect, absorb, or pass 
                            through the cell. The PV cell is composed 
                            of semiconductor material; the “semi” 
                            means that it can conduct electricity 
                            better than an insulator but not as well 
                            as a good conductor like a metal. There 
                            are several different semiconductor 
                            materials used in PV cells.When the 
                            semiconductor is exposed to light, it 
                            absorbs the light’s energy and transfers 
                            it to negatively charged particles in the 
                            material called electrons.This extra 
                            energy allows the electrons to flow 
                            through the material as an electrical 
                            current.Some of the most commonly used 
                            semiconductor materials for PV cells are 
                            silicon, thin film photovoltaics, 
                            perovskite solar cells, and organic 
                            photovoltaics. In addition, there are 
                            also quantum dot solar cells, 
                            multijunction solar cells, and 
                            concentration photovoltaics.


                            <br>Three types of silicon solar cell 
                            materials are thin film, monocrystalline, 
                            and polycrystalline.

                           <br> Silicon is, by far, the most common semiconductor material used in solar cells, representing approximately 95% of the modules sold today. It is also the second most abundant material on Earth (after oxygen) and the most common semiconductor used in computer chips. Crystalline silicon cells are made of silicon atoms connected to one another to form a crystal lattice. This lattice provides an organized structure that makes conversion of light into electricity more efficient.
                            A thin-film solar cell is made by depositing one or more thin layers of PV material on a supporting material such as glass, plastic, or metal. There are two main types of thin-film PV semiconductors on the market today: cadmium telluride (CdTe) and copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS). Both materials can be deposited directly onto either the front or back of the module surface.
                            Perovskite solar cells are a type of thin-film cell and are named after their characteristic crystal structure. Perovskite cells are built with layers of materials that are printed, coated, or vacuum-deposited onto an underlying support layer, known as the substrate. They are typically easy to assemble and can reach efficiencies similar to crystalline silicon.
                            Organic PV, or OPV, cells are composed of carbon-rich (organic) compounds and can be tailored to enhance a specific function of the PV cell, such as bandgap, transparency, or color. OPV cells are currently only about half as efficient as crystalline silicon cells and have shorter operating lifetimes, but could be less expensive to manufacture in high volumes.
